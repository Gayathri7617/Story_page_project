        <h3><b><i> Nature in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.

    <h2>Earth</h2>

    <p>
        <b>Earth</b> is the only planet known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the Solar System, it is third closest to the Sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.[7] Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.<br>
        Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.

    <h2>Water on the Earth</h2>

    <p>
        <b>Water</b> is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen and oxygen (H2O) and is vital for all known forms of life.[29] In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam. Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface.[30] On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds, and precipitation. Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.

    <h2>Bird</h2>
    <img src="./b1.jpg"align="right">
    <p>
        <b>Birds</b> are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves (/ˈeɪviːz/), characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are about ten thousand living species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.

    <h2>AIR</h2>
     <img src="./air.avif"height="200"widtg="200"align="left">
     <p>
        <b>Air</b> is the invisible mixture of gases that surrounds Earth. Air contains important substances, such as oxygen and nitrogen, that most species need to survive. Human beings (Homo sapiens), of course, are one of those species. Sometimes, the word "atmosphere" is used instead of the word "air."<br><br>Air consists of a mixture of various gases such as nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide in different proportions. It consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% of gases such as carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane, hydrogen, ozone, and other gases such as argon, neon, helium, krypton, xenon, and radon.

    <h2>SUN SET</h2>
    <img src="./sun1.jpg" height="280px"width="250px"align="right">
    <p>
        <b>Sunset</b> is the disappearance of the Sun below the horizon due to Earth's rotation. As viewed from everywhere on Earth, it is a phenomenon that happens daily except in areas close to the poles in their respective winters. The equinox Sun sets due west at the moment of both the spring and autumn equinoxes. As viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, the Sun sets to the northwest (or not at all) in the spring and summer, and to the southwest in the autumn and winter; these seasons are reversed for the Southern Hemisphere.<br>
